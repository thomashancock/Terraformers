To-do:

General:
+ Change build system to CMake
	-> Split code based on utility

+ Refactor tile grid
	+> Change HexGrid to just be a square -> hex mapping
	+> Have tiles stored by separate class and positioned by HexGrid

- Allow unit movement
	-> Implement Lua scripts to set tile properties (weights)
	-> Implement algorithm to calculate smallest distance (by weight) to given tile

- Implement Property based entity system
	-> Begin with tiles as test, before moving on to units

- Implement proper input controls
	-> Allow custom Key Bindings
	-> Message bus based system?

Bug Fixes:
	- Fix tile highlighting
	- Blue overlay needs to appear over yellow overlay
